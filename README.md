# Ordinary Differential Equations(ODE) First Half of Diff. Eq.

Many first semester Differential Equations class accross universities will not be able to move at a pace that can cover all the topics deemed by consensus as Introductory Differential Equations Material. Instead of currating a cirriculum that satisfies one classroom's requirements, the goal was to take a union of all Laplace Transform material taught in an applied introductory class and let the student parse the material they will need ad hoc. This project only covers the analytical solves. The graphical, numerical and iterative approaches are not included here.

When teaching pupils Differential Equations in one-on-one settings, there were certain combinations of sources and approaches the really contributed to the understanding of this subject. First stressing categorization of the variables and understanding what makes an identity more special than an equation and how quantifying them as identities contributed to students understanding of solutions. Combining the best aspects and proofs of different sources led to the union of the possible analytical topics an instructor can choose to teach before the first midterm. After the first midterm is when choices in the cirriculum become much more violatile and each larger aspect in the second half of the semester gets their own project from me.
